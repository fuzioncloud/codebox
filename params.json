It can run on any unix-like machine (Linux, Mac OS X). It is an open source component of [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) (Cloud IDE as a Service).\r\n\r\nThe IDE can run on your desktop (Linux or Mac), on your server or the cloud. You can use the [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) service to host and manage IDE instances.\r\n\r\nCodebox is built with web technologies: `node.js`, `javascript`, `html` and `less`. The IDE possesses a very modular and extensible architecture, that allows you to build your own features with through add-ons. Codebox is the first open and modular IDE capable of running both on the Desktop and in the cloud (with offline support).\r\n\r\nThe project is open source under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/blob/master/LICENSE) license.\r\nA screencast of the IDE is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvPEngyXA2A).\r\n\r\n![Image](https://raw.github.com/FriendCode/codebox/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## How to install and run Codebox\r\n\r\n#### Desktop Applications\r\n\r\nInstallers for the latest stable build for **Mac** and **Linux** can be downloaded on the [release page](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/releases).\r\n\r\nInstructions on how to install it can be found for each release.\r\n\r\n#### Install from NPM\r\n\r\nCodebox can be installed as a Node package and use programatically or from the command line.\r\n\r\nInstall Codebox globally using NPM:\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g codebox\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd start the IDE from the command line:\r\n```\r\n$ codebox --root=./myworkspace --open\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse this command to run and open Codebox IDE. By default, Codebox uses GIT to identify you, you can use the option ```--email=john.doe@gmail.com``` to define the email you want to use during GIT operations.\r\n\r\nOthers comand line options are available and can be list with: ```codebox --help```. For deeper configuration, take a look at the documentation about [environment variables](http://help.codebox.io/ide/env.html).\r\n\r\n#### Command line options\r\n\r\n```\r\n-h, --help              output usage information\r\n-V, --version           output the version number\r\n-r, --root [path]       Root folder for the workspace, default is current directory\r\n-t, --templates [list]  Configuration templates, separated by commas\r\n-p, --port [port]       HTTP port\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Developing and testing packages\r\n\r\nDownload and build the source code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone -b new https://github.com/CodeboxIDE/codebox.git\r\n$ cd ./codebox\r\n$ npm install .\r\n$ grunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can easily link packages for testing by creating a folder that will contains all your packages (each should start with the prefix `package-`), then run the command `grunt link --origin=../mypackages`. This command will create symlinks between all the packages in `../mypackages` and the folder where are stored packages used by codebox.\r\n\r\nEverytime you update the code of your package, simply run `grunt resetPkg --pkg=mypackage` in it and restart codebox.\r\n\r\n#### Need help?\r\n\r\nThe IDE's documentation can be found at [help.codebox.io](http://help.codebox.io).
